    - Now will wait for more mail even if not every slot can be looted. If you have 100 mail waiting, the first 20 will make your inventory too full, it will wait and keep looting the next 30 slots
    - After sending mail, will wait twice as long before auto looting to make sure all events fired

    Sped up scanning again, instead of delaying 0.50, 1.32, 1.98 seconds each time a scan fails to return data QA will soft retry and check for data every 0.10 second until 4 seconds total have elapsed. Should result in faster initial scans, but have little impact after that
    - Fixed some auctions taking far too long to scan like gems when using summary

    Increased timeout on splitting to 20 seconds, as it's possible space will be freed up during the split queue due to changes in how posting works
    - Reduced throttle on bag updates to 0.10s, might slightly speed up splitting, might not

    Improved mailer, if you run out of inventory from the looter but you have mail pending due to the auto sender, it will send out the pending mail then keep trying to loot. Let's you do things like mass mail herbs despite the fact that you may only have 5 slots open, rather than 12.

    * Changed the scan logic again
    * Now uses a 0.50 base delay when the event fires, it then scans all auctions and if any have invalid data it sets a flag and then goes through the soft retries -> hard retries, this should greatly improve scan speed as it takes about 1 - 1.5 seconds per a page and can scan 3,500 auctions in ~60 seconds

    * Changed base delay for scanning auctions to 0.50 seconds, and upped the soft retry to 0.66 seconds per failed, this should make rescanning faster and either the same (or slightly less) time when scanning a completely new page
    * Moved everything to modules/

    * Changed retry logic, now if it finds invalid data it will rescan it in 0.50, 1.0 then 1.5 seconds if that fails it will retry the query 3 times and then give up. This should give more reliable owner data without having to send 50 queries.

    * Added /qa list <blah> (See /qa for a list of stuff) lists what options are set to what
    * Cleaned up parseVariableOptions a little
    * Threshold alerts now only show up once, until the item is successfully posted
    * Auctions are now posted by how much they stack by, meaning items that don't stack are posted first (Thus, freeing up space for splitting for items that do stack)
    * Fixed QuickAuctions being unusable until a reload if you closed the AH window during a scan
    * Fixed an error in tradeskills.lua with making 5 of an item the queued way, then another one manually
    * Fixed ALT clicking an item category toggling it (instead of just sending the query)

    * Changed post cap logic, we now base post cap off how many are posted that is the lowest, not how many we have period
    * Added craft queuing. Double click an item in the summary window and type a number of how many you want to make, hit ENTER to save the number, or ESCAPE to clear it, when viewing tradeskill windows you will see a button called "QA", clicking it will show you a list of materials you need/have as well as letting you click the items to make them.

    * Fixed a display bug with canceling if someone matched one of your items buyouts but isn't on the white list
    * Data is now flagged to be reset, and is then reset the next time we see it meaning summary data is available after you've scanned it and not reset when you try and do another scan
    * Moved creation of the summaryCats table to when the summary frame is created, as that tables getting rather large-ish
    * Summary frame quantity is now formated as "[<in AH>/<cap>] <total in AH> (<in Inventory>)" (These are hidden/shown based on what you actually have
    * Added the ability to see what you can, and cannot make in the summary window. If you cannot make an item (AND you have that profession) it'll show an X graphic next to the name, you have to enable this first through /qa tradeskill and open the trade skill windows at least once.

    * Changed /qa cancel to /qa smartcancel
    * Changed smartcancel so that it will now cancel items if you're the only one with any up, and yours are posted below your fall back price
    * Added the ability to set auction time by link/category/default
    * If you are the lowest price on the summary, it'll show the quantity of actives in green, if you aren't it'll show them as red

    * Moved auction time to a variable
    * Moved auction data reseting to our query code instead of doing it every time
    * Moved active auctions to a function

    * Fixed an error for new users due to defaults not being set
    * Fixed a potential issue with a boolean being passed as an filter for auctions
    * Fixed calculation of total items, it won't bug out when we retry to query a page, and it will in general work better

    * Rewrote the scanning code for auctions, it'll be far more efficient, scan faster and have less issues with requesting pages 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 4 -> 8 -> 6 and such, also it's just better in general
    * Cleaned up a lot of code dealing with auction totals for scanning and posting, and some other general code
    * Removed unneeded logging
    * Will now retry if we get a bad item name, or owner name instead of just the latter
    * Fixed retries going on until the user got bored and cancelled them, will actually stop after 5 tries now
    * Moved valid stack checks to be called 0.25 seconds after the last BAG_UPDATE

    * Summaries are now in! Let's you quickly see what the lowest price per item is for different categories, currently enchanting materials, scrolls of enchants, gems and glyphs. Shows lowest buyout (per item) as well as how many are on the Auction House.
    * Reduced time between AUCTION_ITEM_LIST_UPDATE firing and checking for data to 0.20 seconds, then + 0.10 seconds for every retry (Reset to 0.20 seconds when it's successful)
    * Reduced time between query queue checks to 0.25 seconds instead of 0.50 seconds
    * Added an AuctionFrameBrwose.page = page call in QueryAuctionItems if we're scanning so it updates mods correctly

    * Added the ability to force stop queries
    * Added /qa summary to toggle summary frame

    * Fixed a few typos that were causing scan errors
    * Moved Quick Auctions to using localization, as some of the new features will need to be localized
    * Moved the split code into split.lua to clean stuff up

    * Fixed cancel logic, if someone is on your white list and they undercut you, it will cancel it, if they match you and they are on your white list, it will not.

    * Fixed not all auctions being posted due to the uniqueID in the item string
    * Fixed not all auctions being posted since it would think it had valid stacks when it really had nothing to post (You want it to post 2 per stack, you only had 1)
    * Fixed /qa toggle gems and /qa toggle uncut
    overriding each other
    * Fixed "Processing..." being shown instead of item amount to post
    * Fixed DB not being initialized until the Auction House was loaded
    * Cleaned up the configuration for the default/item type/item link settings
    * Cleaned up the code for toggling item types
    * Added the ability to set options by item name, item type, or by default. Meaning you can set it to all cut gems are capped at 2, but Runed Scarlet Ruby's are capped at 5 specifically.
    * Added enchants as a valid toggle now (All enchanting materials of coursE!)
    * Added bidpercent, if you set it to 90% and the buyout is 100g then the bid will be 90g (This is a simple global option, cannot be set per item, or type)
    * Changed add -> addwhite and remove -> removewhite
    * Changed the ordering around on the slash command information
    * Changed FindEmptyInventorySlot to go from 0 -> 4 instead of 4 -> 0 (As everything else does the former)
    * Changed DB format to be cleaner, should upgrade fine

    * Fixed posting auctions not working, changed to a slower system where we first split an item into the required amount (if needed), we post one of it, then wait until it's gone through, then post and so on. Once we finish with that item it moves onto the next. This means posts are slightly slower (Not by much, and mostly depends how much splitting is needed), but more reliable
    * Fixed splitting not checking if the item we were splitting it off of was locked, this means it won't sometimes fail when splitting a stack
    * Fixed special bags (herb/gem/enchanting/glyph/etc) not being recognized as a valid place to put things, now will place items into them if they can be
    * Fixed /qa threshold defaulting to 100g every time
    * Fixed error when toggling item types off
    * Fixed not using the GetItemInfo link for the configurations
    * Fixed data always being saved even if you weren't running a scan, or had a search filter going
    * Fixed how the total posts is calculated, now figues out how much we can post, before actually doing it
    * Fixed how the totals per set are done
    * Cleaned up splitting code, a lot simpler and more accurate

    * Fixed the DB being set to a table
    * Added description tooltips to the buttons
    * Cleaned up the split code (a little)
    * Changed the split code, instead of trying to split everything into the needed stacks it'll now split all of them for that specific item, post the item, split needed for the next, post it and so on to prevent inventory issues. Also means that it won't split unless it's needed, so no splitting then having threshold issues
    * Moved from print() to QA:Echo()

    * Added the ability to set an undercut per an item (/qa undercut <amount> <link>) still can be set globally as well
    * Removed /qa uncut, it's now /qa toggle <gems/uncut/glyphs> that lets you toggle on/off a category of items (These are ALWAYS going to default to 1 per an auction, must use /qa additem to set a specific quantity for it) so you don't have to add every single cut gem, or glyph
    * Changed this from focused on Jewelcrafters so that it can be used by anyone, now includes support for splitting items out of stacks and posting them and has new slash commands (/qa itemadd and /qa itemremove) to add new items it should also manage
    * Changed all the auction code to use buyout per item and bid per item when figuring out everything
    * Trying out a change so that the first scan is 0.50s and then after that it goes to 0.25s to speed it up
    * Added some code so it auto sets new defaults that are added in
    * Renamed the Scan/Post Gems to Scan/Post Items

    * Added specific item caps (/qa cap <amount> <link>) as usual entering 0 will remove the cap.
    * Added the /qa uncut slash command so you can have it manage uncut gems that are unstacked
    * Added a smart cancel, if you put a threshold of 70g, your auction is posted at 70g and someone posts it at 60g, your 70g auction won't be canceled.
    * Added a check to make sure the item link is a valid one

    * Should be ready to release now
    * Changed configuration, now uses a money format instead of gold/silver/copper, which means it's now /qa undercut 1s to undercut by 1 silver, or /qa undercut 1g99s to undercut by 1 gold, 99 silver.
    * Merged /qa spthresh and /qa threshold, if a link is provided after money, it's set specifically, if not, it's set globally
    * Changed scan time to 0.40 instead of 0.50 seconds
    * Added the ability to set specific fallbacks per item
    * Added a chat hook to block the create/cancel spam
    * Added post/cancel status to the buttons
    * Added an option to enable or disable smart undercutting
    * Removed from LoD since it can't be made to auto load on /qa without an external mod
    * Removed the ability to set a specific fallback bid AND buyout, it just sets them the same now
    * Fixed posting not checking if we have enough money to actually post it
    * Fixed posting auctions not resetting the scan data first
    * Fixed posting auctions not checking how many active we had going first
    * Fixed posting auctions not working if you had some auctions already posted
    * Fixed scanning progress updating incorrectly on retries

    * Sort of cleaned up the item scanning code
    * Added a 0.5s delay (Needs tweaking) before scanning so we increase the chance of the owners being available
    * Fixed posting not working if we already had data on everything
    * Fixed check for bad owners, we won't even record there data if the owner isn't available
    * Fixed the maximum post cap checking auctions that had already been sold but no gold delivered yet
    * Added specific thresholds for items on top of the global one

    * Mostly a quick hack, maybe I'll clean it up later, slash command is /qa
    * Made to speed up posting gem auctions, has a button in the auctions tab to find out who is undercutting you, and automatically cancels those auctions, and another that will post gems in your inventory (And only keep X amount in the AH at any one time) and auto undercut people
